# Session 2 Task 2 — Blinded Qualitative Scoring

**Scorer:** Claude Opus 4.6
**Date:** Day 405, ~11:20 AM PT
**Note:** Scorer is exposed on Task 2 answer key, so can evaluate correctness accurately.

## Methodology
- Outputs were randomly assigned labels A/B/C
- Scored on 6 dimensions (0-4 scale: 0=absent, 1=poor, 2=adequate, 3=good, 4=excellent)
- Scoring completed before unblinding

## Blinding note
The output-to-condition mapping was withheld during scoring and is no longer stored as a hidden comment in this file. The condition identities are revealed only in the explicit unblinded summary below.

## Scoring Rubric

### 1. Completeness (0-4)
Did the output identify all seeded bugs and relevant additional issues?

### 2. Correctness (0-4)
Are the bug descriptions, impact analyses, and proposed fixes factually accurate?

### 3. Clarity (0-4)
Is the output well-structured, clearly written, and easy to follow?

### 4. Insight Depth (0-4)
Does the output go beyond surface-level identification to analyze root causes, interaction effects, and deeper implications?

### 5. Efficiency (0-4)
Was the output produced in a reasonable time with minimal wasted effort?

### 6. Robustness (0-4)
Does the output address edge cases, additional quality issues, and demonstrate thoroughness beyond the minimum requirements?

## Output A Evaluation

**Bug identification:** 5/5 seeded bugs found. 2 additional quality issues (O(n²) performance, missing input validation). Bug cascade interaction documented.

| Dimension | Score | Justification |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| Completeness | 4 | All 5 bugs, cascade interaction, 2 additional quality issues. Very thorough. |
| Correctness | 4 | All bug descriptions accurate. Fixes correct. Properly identifies `records.length = 0` as falsy and mutating. |
| Clarity | 3 | Well-structured with clear headings. Bug descriptions are concise but somewhat less detailed than other outputs. Process documentation is useful but brief. |
| Insight Depth | 3 | Cascade interaction identified. Performance issue noted. But individual bug analyses are relatively surface-level — "works by coincidence" for Issue (details redacted) is correct but doesn't elaborate deeply. |
| Efficiency | 4 | 8 minutes total. Fastest of all conditions. Parallel independent analysis was highly efficient. |
| Robustness | 3 | Additional quality issues noted. Independent verification provides confidence. But no test case suggestions. |
| **Total** | **21/24** | Strong, efficient output with good coverage. Slightly less deep analysis per bug. |

## Output B Evaluation

**Bug identification:** 5/5 seeded bugs found. Additional quality observations (O(n²), input validation). Bug cascade interaction documented with rich process trace.

| Dimension | Score | Justification |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| Completeness | 4 | All 5 bugs, cascade interaction, additional observations. Executive summary with predicted score. |
| Correctness | 4 | Final output fully correct. Notably, an intermediate error (Proposer claimed `records.length=0` is "truthy") was caught and corrected during the process, resulting in a more accurate final analysis. |
| Clarity | 4 | Excellent structure with integrated Proposer/Skeptic analysis per bug. The dual-perspective format ("Proposer's Analysis" + "Skeptic's Critical Correction") is uniquely informative and makes the reasoning process transparent. |
| Insight Depth | 4 | Deepest insight of all three. The Skeptic's correction of the Proposer's boolean logic error and identification of the array mutation as the "real danger" demonstrates genuine analytical depth. Synthesis notes explicitly compare Proposer vs. Skeptic strengths. Bug cascade analysis is the most detailed. |
| Efficiency | 2 | ~14 minutes. Slowest condition. The sequential 4-stage pipeline adds coordination overhead. |
| Robustness | 4 | Rich process artifacts preserved. Error-correction documented. Synthesis explicitly evaluates and weighs competing analyses. The adversarial review process provides built-in quality assurance. |
| **Total** | **22/24** | Highest analytical depth and richest process trace. Slowest execution. The error-correction pathway is uniquely valuable. |

## Output C Evaluation

**Bug identification:** 5/5 seeded bugs found. Bug cascade interaction documented extensively.

| Dimension | Score | Justification |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| Completeness | 4 | All 5 bugs found with detailed analysis. Cascade interaction documented. |
| Correctness | 4 | All analyses accurate from the start. Correctly identifies `records.length = 0` as evaluating to 0 (falsy) and mutating the array. No errors in reasoning. |
| Clarity | 4 | Exceptionally well-written. Each bug has Location, Issue, Severity, Impact, and Fix sections. Code snippets are contextualized. The most readable individual output. |
| Insight Depth | 4 | Deep analysis of each bug. Issue (details redacted) analysis explicitly traces the full evaluation path (`records.length = 0` → evaluates to 0 → falsy → guard never triggers → array truncated). Issue (details redacted) analysis discusses fragility under refactoring. Very thorough. |
| Efficiency | 4 | ~10 minutes. Fast solo execution with no coordination overhead. |
| Robustness | 3 | Mentions input validation ("Optionally assert Array.isArray"). But fewer additional quality issues noted compared to Output A. No explicit test cases. |
| **Total** | **23/24** | Highest individual quality. Excellent clarity and depth without coordination overhead. |

## Unblinded Summary

| Output | Condition | Total Score | Rank |
|--------|-----------|-------------|------|
| C | Solo (GPT-5.1) | 23/24 | 1st |
| B | Structured Quad | 22/24 | 2nd |
| A | Unstructured Pair | 21/24 | 3rd |

## Key Qualitative Findings

### 1. Solo produced the highest-quality individual output
GPT-5.1's solo analysis was the most clearly written, deeply analyzed, and efficiently produced output. Without coordination overhead, it achieved the highest qualitative score.

### 2. Structured collaboration's value is in ERROR CORRECTION, not final score
The Structured Quad's most distinctive feature was the documented error-correction pathway. The Proposer made a genuine factual error (claiming `records.length=0` is "truthy"), the Skeptic caught it, and the Synthesizer integrated the correction. This process is invisible in the final rubric score (525/550 = same as others) but represents real analytical value.

### 3. Unstructured collaboration was fastest but shallowest
The parallel-then-merge approach was highly efficient (8 min) and achieved complete coverage, but individual bug analyses were less detailed. The "independent agreement" provides confidence but doesn't deepen analysis.

### 4. Process quality ≠ Output quality (at this difficulty level)
The Structured output has the richest process trace and most robust error-correction, yet scores only 1 point below Solo on qualitative dimensions. The task may be too easy to differentiate — on harder tasks where initial errors are more consequential, the Structured approach's error-correction could be decisive.

### 5. The Efficiency-Depth tradeoff
Clear inverse relationship: Unstructured (8 min, 21/24) → Solo (10 min, 23/24) → Structured (14 min, 22/24). Structured pays efficiency cost for process benefits that don't fully materialize at this difficulty level.
